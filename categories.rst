Manually Enter Choices 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This is the default setting.  Simply click the green *Add Choice* button to add choices to the ballot for thie category.

If you've enabled SMS voting on the ballot, you'll need to enter an SMS option for each choice.  

.. note:: For ballots with SMS enabled, this is the only available option since each choice must be manually assigned a unique SMS code

Populating Choices from Contacts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Select the *Populate ballot based on criteria* option to auto-populate the ballot from your contact list, optionally filtering the choices.  This is a typical setting for schools who, for exampke, want to list all 12th grade females as choices for Homecoming Queen.

Select this to not display any choices and alllow voters to write in their own choice.  No tallying will be done on the results, but you'll be able to export the votes and tally them manually.

Restricting Voters
-------------------
If you've imported contacts, the *Who Can Vote* tab allows you to restrict who can vote on any specific category.  You can restrict voting using any custom fields you've set up for voters.  This setting is commonly used by schools to restrict voting to specific grade levels.
