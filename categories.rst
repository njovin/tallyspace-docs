Manually Enter Choices 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This is the default setting.  Simply click the green *Add Choice* button to add choices to the ballot for thie category.

If you've enabled SMS voting on the ballot, you'll need to enter an SMS option for each choice.  

.. note:: For ballots with SMS enabled, this is the only available option since each choice must be manually assigned a unique SMS code

Populating Choices from Contacts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Select the *Populate ballot based on criteria* option to auto-populate the ballot from your contact list, optionally filtering the choices.  This is a typical setting for schools who, for exampke, want to list all 12th grade females as choices for Homecoming Queen.
