Overview
===============
There are a few concepts you should be familiar with to understand how to set up and administer your ballots on TallySpace.

Ballots
--------
The first thing you'll do when setting up a vote or survey is create a ballot.  A ballot is simply a collection of one or more Categories.  It's useful to group categories into a ballot because you can set security requirements on a per-ballot basis, which will allow voters to log in once to vote on multiple cateogories.

Categories
------------
Categories (or questions) are individual things voters vote on.  Each category may contain multiple choices or candidates (or none at all, in the case of a write-in category).  

Categories on the same ballot *can* have different security settings, which allows you to set up a single ballot where some voters can see/vote on some categories, but not others. 

Choices
----------------------
Each category can contain one or more choices (or candidates). These are the options voters choose from when casting their votes.  

Contacts
---------
Contacts most typically contain a list of approved voters.  Importing or entering a contact list allows voters to log in with information they already know, without the hassle of having to sign up for an account on their own.

For categories with a large number of choices, you can also populate the choices from your contacts list.

Contact Custom Fields 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
TallySpace allows you to import or track any information about your contacts you like.  This makes it a breeze to control who can vote on each category in a very granular way. "Grade Level" is an example of a cusotm field - in many cases a school will only want to allow 12th graders to vote for 12th grade president.  Custom fields are what makes this possible.
