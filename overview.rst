Overview
===============
There are a few concepts you should be familiar with to understand how to set up and administer your ballots on TallySpace.

Ballots
^^^^^^^^^
The first thing you'll do when setting up a vote or survey is create a ballot.  A ballot is simply a collection of one or more Categories.  It's useful to group categories into a ballot because you can set security requirements on a per-ballot basis, which will allow voters to log in once to vote on multiple cateogories.

Categories
^^^^^^^^^^^
Categories (or questions) are individual things voters vote on.  Each category may contain multiple choices or candidates (or none at all, in the case of a write-in category).  

Categories on the same ballot *can* have different security settings, which allows you to set up a single ballot where some voters can see/vote on some categories, but not others. 

Candidates or Choices
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Each category can contain one or more candidates (or choices). These are the options voters choose from when casting their votes.
